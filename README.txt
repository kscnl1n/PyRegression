This is a project I built to learn Python.
It is a very simple python calculator that allows one to 
predict the output of a dataset by using Gradient Descent-based
linear regression.

USE:
1. initialize classifier lr.LinearRegression()
2. Load data in the format of exampledata.txt into classifier.load_data('filepath)
Make sure you have only one x and y columns OR multiple x columns and one y column.
Ensure there are no more than 5 significant figures in your data set.
3. Predict outcomes using classifier.predict(matrix-shaped-(1x))

Enjoy :)
